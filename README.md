## Description

A website where you Can Add Sylists and Clients to a database.

<!-- Brainstorming
- able to add a list of stylists working at the salon, and for each stylist, add clients who see that stylist.
-The stylists have specific specialties, so each client can only see (belong to) a single stylist.
_ able to see a list of all stylists.
_ able to select a stylist, see their details, and see a list of all clients that belong to that stylist.
- add new stylists to our system when they are hired.
_ able to add new clients to a specific stylist. I should not be able to add a client if no stylists have been added.
